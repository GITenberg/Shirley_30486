description: Set during the Napoleonic wars at a time of national economic struggles,
  Shirley is an unsentimental yet passionate depiction of conflict among classes,
  sexes, and generations. Struggling manufacturer Robert Moore considers marriage
  to the wealthy and independent Shirley Keeldar, yet his heart lies with his cousin
  Caroline. Shirley, meanwhile, is in love with Robert's brother, an impoverished
  tutor. As industrial unrest builds to a potentially fatal pitch, can the four be
  reconciled?
